                    Stephanie Chitwood is a freelance Junior UX/UI designer looking to connect! She would like to specialize in creating fun and innovative designs that alleviate pain points and provide an enjoyable user experience. 
                    Stephanie enjoys how in depth the design process is, collecting and understanding the user and user data, to make sure the features that are offered are precisely what they want to see. Stephanie enjoys working in a group of individuals that communicate and collaborate to challenge their own design thoughts. She is a learner, quick on her feet and thrives in a fast paced, fun environment. 
                    Although Steph started late in the game with her career, she is determined to be one of the best. When Steph isnâ€™t designing you can usually find her enjoying an evening on the town with her friends or walking the beach looking for agates.
